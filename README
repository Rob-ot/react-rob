
We want to capture errors in production but we can't run react in production mode because it has some slow validation checks and stuff.

I've gone through and changed the slow performance checks to check "process.env.REACT_SLOW_DEBUG" instead of "process.env.NODE_ENV".

So we can always have NODE_ENV as dev and change REACT_SLOW_DEBUG if we want the slow debugging extras.

The tests still use normal react from npm because I couldn't get it to work.
